The USB HID automation module proved that an ESP32-S2 can reliably emulate a keyboard and mouse to run fast, scripted system interactions. 
This showed how HID devices can be both powerful tools and potential security risks. 
By automating commands safely in a controlled environment, the project demonstrated how USB-based attacks work, why they are effective, and how defenders can detect or block them. 
The system highlights the importance of monitoring USB behavior and creates a foundation for future defensive research and educational demonstrations.

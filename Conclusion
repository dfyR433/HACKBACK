Conclusion — USB HID Automation

The USB HID automation component of this project demonstrated that microcontrollers such as the ESP32-S2 can reliably emulate human-interface devices to execute scripted system interactions. 
Through the development of a custom HID control framework and its evaluation within a controlled test environment, the study illustrated how unauthorized HID devices may introduce significant security risks, including rapid command injection and system manipulation. 
The findings emphasize the need for strengthened device-level access policies, USB port monitoring, and user awareness to prevent misuse. 
Overall, the module provides a safe and reproducible platform for analyzing physical-layer attack vectors and supports the broader goal of advancing defensive cybersecurity research and education.

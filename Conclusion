Project Title: USB HID Automation System for Cybersecurity Education

Project Summary:
This project presents a USB Human Interface Device (HID) automation system designed to demonstrate cybersecurity concepts and ethical hacking techniques in a controlled, educational environment. The system emulates keyboard and mouse inputs to automate tasks, simulate attacks, and test security responses without compromising real networks or devices. By providing a safe platform for experimenting with automation and penetration testing, this project promotes hands-on learning in computer security, programming, and embedded systems. The results highlight the potential of HID-based tools for cybersecurity education while emphasizing ethical and responsible use.

Event: ISEF 2026

Top-left: Abstract
A hybrid system combining host-level HID monitoring and a network profiler shows improved detection versus single-layer defenses. Experiments were run on owned hardware with only benign automation.

Left column: Problem
- HID devices can inject keystrokes with little verification.
- Network-only defenses miss local actions.
- Goal: combine host + network signals for detection.

Center column: System Diagram (replace with architecture_diagram.png)
[HID Device] → [Client Host] → [Host Agent] → [Fusion & Logger] ← [Intelligent Router] ← network

Right column: Methods
- Baseline: 100 human typing sessions
- Automation: 300 benign automation runs
- Metrics: TPR, FPR, latency, ROC AUC

Bottom-left: Results (SIMULATED EXAMPLE)
- Host AUC: 0.89
- Router AUC: 0.66
- Hybrid AUC: 0.94
- Median latency (ms): Host 80 ms, Router 300 ms, Hybrid 75 ms

Bottom-right: Conclusion & Ethics
Combining host and network signals improves detection and reduces latency. All tests run in controlled environment; HID actions are harmless typing; no exploit code is included.
